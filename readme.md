## Edible Campus Human Recognition Project

We use TensorFlow to classify videos from [UCSB's Edible Campus program](https://sustainability.ucsb.edu/ediblecampus/) with the aim of determining whether humans are present at the garden or not. We envision that our solution might be implemented to guard against theft or vandalism.

### Team Members
Gwyneth Allwright, Swaroop Rao and Sabrina Tsui. This is our project for CS293B Cloud Computing (Spring 2020) at UCSB.
